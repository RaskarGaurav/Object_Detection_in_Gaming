# Object_Detection_in_Gaming
This project is a prototype for implementing Artificial Neural Networks(CNN) in real-time gaming.

- This project is implemented and tested in a real-time game. Specifically "Forza Horizon 4".
- The project is developed with YOLO V5.
- Prototype only consists of a limited dataset. The original source for a dataset is confidential.
- I have provided two videos for applied test results. "test.mp4" & "test_exp9.mp4"
- I used JUPYTER NOTEBOOK with a personal GPU. Instead that using GOOGLE COLAB with TPU can improve its accuracy.
- "detect.ipynb" consist of driver code in PYTHON programming language. 

Refer to this project for your future improvements in CNN implementation.
